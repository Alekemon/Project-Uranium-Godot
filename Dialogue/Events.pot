msgid "EVENT_MOKI_TOWN_THEO_HOME_5"
msgstr "A harsh lesson, to be sure...\nbut losing is as much as part of being a Trainer as winning.\nHe had his heart set on this day being perfect,\nso losing right off the bat is somewhat of a shock."

msgstr "B-but it isn't fair...\n\\PN got the better starter 'n me...\nNow I'm never gonna win!"

msgid "EVENT_MOKI_TOWN_THEO_HOME_11"
msgstr "Then you'll have to catch more Pokémon to balance out your team's weaknesses. Besides, a well-raised Pokémon can still win, even at a disadvantage. There's no sense in giving up before you even begin."
