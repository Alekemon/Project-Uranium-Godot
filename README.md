# Project-Uranium-Godot
A work in progress re-implementation of the game Pokemon Uranium in the Godot Engine.
This project will only contain the Godot project and its source code. All game assets must be obtained from the original game. 
Discord Server is up! Feel free to ask anything! https://discord.gg/Ay3c3gg

Please note that this game is neither developed by, nor endorsed by Nintendo, Game Freak, and The Pok√©mon Company.

# Why am I doing this?
Because Pokemon Uranium is a great game but has technical flaws. 
One is that the game's preformace is bad because it is built with the aging game engine, RPG Maker XP. This engine uses directdraw, an old and obsolete graphics API, that preforms baddly with today's computers. 
Two is that it only supports the Windows PC platform. With Godot the game can run on Windows, Mac, Linux and Android support is also planned.
Lastly I could fix existing bugs in the game.

# Current progress
Only a limited portion of the game is playable currently.
